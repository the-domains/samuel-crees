For me things are a bit different, I realized I need to lose weight, and I prayed, and thought about my eating habits. The Lord helped me lose from 255 lbs. down to 220 lbs.  I have bad knee joints, that ache a lot, so I found things good for them, and I take then absolutely everyday, like tummeric, glucosomine, and other things.  I now need to start walking more than I do at work. I am praying that I can lose another 10 to 15 lbs. this year, it might just help with everything. The thing is we do know that poor eating shortens life, smoking shortens life, no exercise shortens life.  So why am I doing this?  Well, I am 60 now, and have some health issues, and i don't want to be a burden to my wife, or my children at some point just because i am selfish, and want to eat fried foods all the time, or eat Ice Cream after every meal.  I actually want to enjoy life, and my years left here, and enjoy them with everyone. So since i could not find the picture i wanted, I will show one of my toys, and me in front of it.
