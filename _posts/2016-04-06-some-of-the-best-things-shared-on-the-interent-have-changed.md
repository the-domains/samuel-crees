Some of the best things shared on the Interent, have changed from version to version, but one I love to share, and is written by a man no one wants to recognize, mainly because of his way of looking at life.  He wrote many bokks, and was an advisor to many, and so I will share the real version, and you will reocgnize it right off.

"God, give us grace to accept with serenity   
the things that cannot be changed,   
Courage to change the things   
which should be changed,   
and the Wisdom to distinguish   
the one from the other.

Living one day at a time,   
Enjoying one moment at a time,   
Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,   
Taking, as Jesus did,   
This sinful world as it is,   
Not as I would have it,   
Trusting that You will make all things right,   
If I surrender to Your will,   
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life,   
And supremely happy with You forever in the next.

Amen." 

#### Note About The Serenity Prayer's Real Author 

You'll
find many references online, some not being sure who really wrote the
above prayer, some claiming that Reinhold Niebuhr was not actually the 
author. Many have researched it, including trying to find out if it even
goes back to 500 A.D. Despite all the research though, it still goes 
back to Niebuhr being the author. He has many other quotes just as good.
