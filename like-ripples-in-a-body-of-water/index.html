<p>When I was a kid I loved to throw rocks, pebbles, and other objects 
into the small pond by our house to see the differences in the rings or 
out ward waves as they moved across the water towards the shore. Watch 
closely, the splash of the object is over in an instant, but the ripples
 continue.</p><p>At first it was just fun and soothing to watch the 
rings move so harmoniously ever out wards, not just one for the one 
object that was thrown in, but hundreds of rings, one right after the 
other, and they slowed, and eventually ended, but it took time, and I 
even doubt sometimes that they really stopped when I saw them no more.</p><p>Life
 is like this view of reality, in a physical analogy, for when we do 
something it has an effect that ripples ever outward from it origin to 
effect all around it. And in like manner it is not just one ripple but 
hundreds, one right after the other, and if we don't renew them from 
time to time they diminish in and eventually stop altogether.</p><p>For 
if I did something for someone else, as Jesus did for others, then the 
results would spread and many would know, and some would even come to 
expect the same for themselves. Things no matter how small have an 
effect, for Jesus did many great things, that are documented in many 
places, and not just the Bible, but then he also was given a small drink
 of water by a well, that changed a life for ever. So no matter how 
small the action it still has far reaching effects.</p><p>Our home life 
is like this and so is our work life, and ultimately our business life 
as well. Each move affects another, and each idea has an effect. And in 
our modern age of technology this is increasingly true, for our small 
pond of water is now a global expanse, that has the furthermost reaches 
of our world to touch and share. Those rings are spreading ever out 
ward.</p><p>Now, can I share a little secret from above, where I spoke 
of what was thrown into the water; big rocks, big waves, little pebbles 
little waves, and tree limbs, or odd shaped objects, start out as 
irregular waves, but soon temper to rings just as all the other objects 
thrown in did before they reached the shoreline, and ending.</p><p>So do
 ideas when shared, may at first seem useless, and not worth sharing, 
because they are not quite right, but with time and sharing they too 
become uniform and tried through the efforts of many others as they head
 for the shoreline. You my friend are ever affecting everyone around 
you, with the slightest things that you do, so imagine if you will when 
it is done on a global scale.</p><p>Compumatrix my friends is just such a
 company of a very new concept, but one that is to help others, who do 
not have the same advantages as those with real world power to back 
them, and this company has grown despite much speculation that it would 
not endure, for the long run.</p><p>In the end, we will see a Company 
that has endured the test of time, and has blessed the lives of many, 
and ultimately altered the very facets of life, and business as we know 
it today, for those rings are still spreading ever outward, causing 
changes everywhere they go!</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Samuel Crees</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
