My web sties will be an extension of Life!  What it takes to see life, what it takes to live life, what it takes to feed life, and to an end what it takes to be that life for others to grow from.

I call most of my sites, simplt; "A Way of Life!"

For a minute think about this concept; A person perhaps 55 years of age, thinks that he is slowing down, and doesn't always feel full of vigor, and is tired a lot. So he visits his doctor, who asks when was his last physical done?  To that he replied; I have no idea.  So the doctor says, let's do one right now and see if you have any problems that need addressing.

The doctor finds your blood pressure is in the hypertensive range, and that your a bit over weight, and do not exercise regularly. He also finds that your eating habits, and desk duty in front of a computer most of the time, has caused poor circulation to your lower body. Pls, some water retention.

So the doctor decides to put you on a mild blood pressure medicine, and wants you to start excercising, and controlling your eating habits, to try can change the environment in your body, and then come back for consistent check ups, to see how this is working.

And the word of wisdom here is simple: It took years to get your body to this point, which is not good; and so it is going to take alot of devoted time and effort to bring it back to better health.  There is no such thing as a magic pill, but with a change in mind, ideas, attitude, and Life, It can be done! It is just a matter of accepting it, for life.

I am adding my site, and my personal seal as a picture to contemplate, and to think about. For as you think about this picture, realize that you are special beyond understanding, and what has taken a lifetime to create so far, is not ever changed over night. There are many very special things in your life that makes you, and individual, a person like no other, and I would never try to change that, but we can 'All' use some improvements, and those are what I want to share, like living alonger a fuller life.
