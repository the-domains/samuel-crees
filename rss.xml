            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of the best things shared on the Interent, have changed from version to version, but one I love to share, and is written by a man no one wants to recognize, mainly because of his way of looking at life.Â  He wrote many bokks, and was an advisor to many, and so I will share the real version, and you will reocgnize it right off.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Like Ripples in a Body of Water</h1><p>When I was a kid I loved to throw rocks, pebbles, and other objects 
into the small pond by our house to see the differences in the rings or 
out ward waves as they moved across the water towards the shore. Watch 
closely, the splash of the object is over in an instant, but the ripples
 continue.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3fe14482-7c8b-4fa2-8a76-d681d2f4e27e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
